# Vision

With rust, it is amazing to write secure and memory-safe distributed web services. 
This small framework should benefit web developers who want to build microservices, to stitch them easily. 

This tool should help to make tiny services faster and should allow independent servies to connect each other through grpc ( may mutually exclusive) - similar to https://dapr.io/.
