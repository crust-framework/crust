What rust offers? 

Rust is an amazing language to write secure and memory-safe apps, this can help a lot in developing small memory footprint and better distributed web services. 

We all face a challege that once our apps grows we need to execute more requests in a VM by reducing factors like request serving time, cpu, memory and many other. Rust can heavily benefit in these areas.

This framework should benefit web developers who want to build microservices, to stitch them easily. 

The crust cli tool should help to make tiny services faster and should allow independent services to connect each other through grpc ( may mutually exclusive) - inpiration https://dapr.io/.
